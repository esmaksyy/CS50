        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Esma. I have turned coding into a passion and stand out with my keen interest in computer sciences. I completed my education in Economics at Pamukkale University, and currently, I am pursuing Human Resources Management at Anadolu University. My love for outdoor activities keeps me active; I enjoy camping, hiking in the mountains, and exploring new places. However, my favorite activity is coding at the computer. Meanwhile, my loyal companion Kabak, a dog of mine, keeps me company. He usually sleeps while I work, but his peaceful presence is a true source of inspiration for me.</p>

        <h3>Passion for Computer Sciences</h3>
        <p>I can express my passion for computer sciences as follows: Computer sciences allow me to freely use my imagination and creatively solve problems. Each line of code represents the steps I take in my journey to find solutions to challenges. As I create my first webpage, I am excited to invite you to join me on this adventure. Happy browsing!</p>
