If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Answer: We need to collect the music files of the top 100 songs of 2018 and create a dataset containing the features of these songs. To characterize the sonic aura of music, it will be necessary to identify various musical features from songs. Some of these are: Tempo (bpm), Rhythm (beats and bars), Tone (key), melody intensity, Instrumentation (instruments used), Song duration, Balance of vocals and instrumentals, Dynamic range (difference between soft and loud), energy level
Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Answer 2: How a listener perceives and experiences music can vary depending on listening habits, mood, and environmental factors. These factors can influence how music is perceived, and a characterization based solely on musical characteristics may be inadequate. Surveys and surveys can be used to understand listeners' music preferences, listening habits, and the emotional experiences they associate with music.
